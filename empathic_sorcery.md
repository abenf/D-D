`[Flavor text]`

## Level 3: Empathic Spells
When you reach a sorcerer level specified in the Empathic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|  Sorcerer Level | Spells  |
|--|--|
| 3 | *Beast Bond*<br/> *Calm Emotions*<br/> *Comprehend Languages*<br/> *Friends*<br/> *Warding Bond*<br/> |
| 5 | *Beacon of Hope*<br/> *Sending*<br/>  |
| 7 | *Locate Creature*<br/> *Mordenkainen's Private Sanctuary*<br/>  |
| 9 | *Awaken*<br/> *Circle of Power*<br/>  |

## Level 3: Emotional Intelligence
Your attunement to the inner lives of others grants you keen understanding of their moods and feelings. Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You comprehend the target's true emotions even if they are not immediately reflected in the creature's words and actions. If the target has an intelligence of 3 or less or is otherwise incapable of conventional emotion, you are unable to read them.


## Level 6: Magnetic Presence
Whenever you cast the *Friends* cantrip from your Empathic Spells feature, you can expend a number of Sorcery Points to intensify its effect and increase its influence. When casting the cantrip in this way, all targets have disadvantage on the Wisdom saving throw made to avoid the charmed condition and you have Advantage on any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain its Concentration. The number of targets, duration, and range of the cantrip depend on the amount of Sorcery Points expended:

| Sorcery Point<br/>Cost | Targets Affected<br/>(up to)| Duration<br/>(up to) | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 10 minutes | 10 ft |
| 3 | 1 | 1 hour | 30 ft |
| 6 | 3 | 1 hour | 30 ft |
| 10 | 10 | 1 hour | 30 ft|
| 14 | 25 | 8 hours | 60 ft |
| 18 | 50 | 24 hours | 120 ft |

All other regular limitations of the cantrip remain in place. Also, you cannot use other Metamagic options as part of the casting involved in using this Feature. 


## Level 14: Wave of Emotions
When an ally you can see receives magical damage, you can use your Reaction to shield them from it and reflect the damage back towards the attacker as a rippling sheet of psychic energy that moves across the terrain. Your ally takes no damage and each creature in a 60-foot Cone makes a Charisma saving throw against your Spell Save DC suffering 3d6 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw succumb to an overwhelming emotion of your choice and have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.


## Level 18: Cult of Personality
When using your Magnetic Presence, you can choose to expand the reach of your influence. In addition to the casting of the *Friends* cantrip, choose one of the following options:

 - You can suggest a reasonable course of activity to one of the affected creatures in the same way as the spell *Suggestion*.
 - You can soothe the passions of all affected creatures in the same way as the spell *Calm Emotions*.
 - You can speak a one-word command to all affected creatures in the same way as the spell *Command*.

Unless stated otherwise, the normal target limits of these spells are ignored in favor of those from Magnetic Presence and any saving throw normally made as part of the casting of those spells is not made---only the Wisdom saving throw as part of *Friends*. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
