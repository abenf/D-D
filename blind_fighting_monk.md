# Warrior of the Blind Path
`[Flavor Text]`
## Level 3: Disciple of the Shrouded Way 
Either by necessity or practiced discipline, sight is a mere luxury which you have shed. When you have the Blinded condition during combat, whether by magical or mundane means, you are not hindered; attacks made by or against you do not have Disadvantage or Advantage, respectively, and you can make sight-based ability checks. When Blinded, you can spend 1 Focus Point and gain the benefits of the Blind Fighting Fighting Style for a number of turns equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 turn).

## Level 3: Trust the Shrouded Way
You know the Guidance cantrip.

## Level 6: Beckon the Shrouded Way
As a Bonus Action, you billow forth a 10-foot radius cloud (Sphere) of magical smoke from your outstretched hand, centered on yourself or a point within reach that dissipates at the start of your next turn. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Any creature that starts or ends its turn inside the cloud must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffers a coughing fit and the Incapacitated condition until the cloud dissipates. The cloud is ineffective if created in or subjected to strong winds.

## Level 11: Anticipate the Shrouded Way
Your heightened awareness expands beyond space to include time. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, make a number of rolls of your Martial Arts Die equal to your Proficiency bonus. You can add any of these anticipation rolls to an attack you make. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can augment an attack roll in this way only once per turn.

Each anticipation roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused anticipation rolls.

## Level 17: One with the Shrouded Way
Now, when you Beckon the Shrouded Way, you can spend Focus Points to increase the smoke cloud's size and potency. For each Focus Point you spend:
 - 5-feet is added to the range and radius of the cloud
 - 5-feet is added to the range of your Blind Fighting style
 - The Constitution Save DC is increased by 1
 - The cloud's duration is increased by 1 turn
